        Short for "Electronic Sports", eSports are competitive gaming on a professional level. ESports are usually competitions in video game genres such as first-person shooters, like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or multiplayer online battle arena-games, like DOTA 2 or League of Legends, among others.
          </p>
          <p>
          The first eSports tournament happened in 1980 in the game Space Invaders with an attendance of 10.000 people. A lot has happened since, and tournaments are now viewed by millions of people on sites like Twitch. The largest prize pool to date is 24 million US Dollars at The International 2017, an annual DOTA 2 tournament.

          <p>With millions of dollars on the line, the world of eSports is extremely competitive. Though physical health is important for any competitor, eSport competitors focus more on training of the mind. A professional eSport team may practice more than 50 hours per week, working on strategies and having to keep up with game updates, which is why bootcamps are a rather vital part of it. If a team wants to improve on their ranking and all around performance they attend bootcamps in order to get better as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
          ESports is widely considered a legitimate sport - leaders in Japan are even trying to bring eSports to the 2020 summer Olympics. The world of eSports is growing rapidly and at Blaavandshuk Sports park, we are committed to creating a space where the next world champions can practise and help them reach their goals.
